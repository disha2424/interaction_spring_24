<P>There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.

	<ul>
		<li>5 Shelves</li>
		<li>35 Books</li>
		<li>410 Pages</li>
		<li>40 Lines</li>
		<li>80 Letters</li>

	</ul>
